This project is under BSD open source license. Its on the most unrestrictive
freeware license possible. No warranty implied or given.

It is a tool written in C for management of Bosch ME7 firmware dumps.

It should generally autodetect checksum/CRC blocks, but is known not to work
with:

4Z7907551AA.bin
4Z7907551R.bin
4Z7907551S.bin
ferrari360.bin

For testing, regions can be overriden in an ini file. See sample.ini for
available block/image options, and bins/ferrari360.ini for an example of using
the info and dump sections.

Feel free to contribute to the project!

BUILDING:
---------

Under unix or cygwin, "make" should work.

Under Windows MSVSS/nmake , type "build clean" then "build"

RUNNING:
--------
To check image.bin:

 me7sum image.bin

To override detected checksum/CRC blocks, and/or display dump information:

 me7sum -i image.ini image.bin

To output corrected checksums (the "-i" option is still available)

 me7sum [-i image.ini] image.bin out.bin

Note that if me7sum cannot completely detect checksum/CRC locations correctly,
it will not output a file!
