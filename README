freeware license possible. No warranty implied or given.

It is a tool written in C for management of Bosch ME7.1 firmware dumps.

The latest binary releases are always available here:

RUNNING:
--------

*********************************
** THIS PROGRAM HAS KNOWN BUGS **
*********************************

To check image.bin:

  ME7Check image.bin
  me7sum image.bin

To output corrected checksums:

  me7sum image.bin out.bin

Note that if me7sum cannot completely detect checksum/CRC locations correctly,
it will not output a file!

** Always use me7sum on a original version of your bin first to make sure it is
   compatible! **

** Make sure to check all corrected bins with ME7Check.exe before flashing
   them! **

KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------
** RSA signature support is experimental, and may have bugs! **

ME7Check should not fail on RSA corrected bins. If it does, please email the
binary to me or post on Nefmoto.

DO NOT FLASH ANY BINS without a backup ECU or a way to restore a known good
bin or you may be stranded!

It should generally autodetect checksum/CRC blocks, but is known not to work
on non VAG Motronic bins, eg:

ferrari360.bin

ME7.5 is also currently unsupported but might work.

BUILDING:
---------
Under unix or cygwin, "make" should work.

Under Windows MSVSS/nmake, type "build clean" then "build"

CONTRIBUTING:
-------------
