RUNNING:
--------

*********************************
** THIS PROGRAM HAS KNOWN BUGS **
*********************************

To check image.bin:

  ME7Check image.bin
  me7sum image.bin

To override detected checksum/CRC blocks, and/or display dump information:

  me7sum [-i image.ini] image.bin

To output corrected checksums (the "-i" option is still available, but optional)

  me7sum [-i image.ini] image.bin out.bin

** If in doubt, omit the -i option. You shouldn't use it unless you know what
you are doing. **

Note that if me7sum cannot completely detect checksum/CRC locations correctly,
it will not output a file!

** Make sure to check all bins with ME7Check.exe before flashing them! **

KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------
It should generally autodetect checksum/CRC blocks, but is known not to work
with ME7.1.1, eg:

4Z7907551N.bin
4Z7907551R.bin
4Z7907551S.bin
4Z7907551T.bin
4Z7907551AA.bin

Or non VAG Motronic bins, eg:

ferrari360.bin

There are also various ME7.1 checksum areas that are not correctly
detected/supported ("ROMSYS" according to ME7Check):

http://nefariousmotorsports.com/forum/index.php?topic=3347.msg32324#msg32324

ME7.5 is also currently unsupported.

For testing, regions can be overridden in an ini file. See sample.ini for
available block/image options, and ferrari360.ini for an example of using
the info and dump sections.

BUILDING:
---------
Under unix or cygwin, "make" should work.

Under Windows MSVSS/nmake , type "build clean" then "build"

Under unix or cygwin, "make" should work.
