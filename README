This project is under BSD open source license. Its on the most unrestrictive
freeware licese possible. No warranty implied or given. 

Its a tool written in C to management Bosch ME7 firmware dumps. Currently its been targeted to work
with config files (simple ini variety) but could easily be adapted to use XML in future versions. Its
currently only doing calculation, I don't write the updated checksums back to the file, again a future
iteration could address this (easy to do).

Enjoy!
