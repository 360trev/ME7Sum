It is a tool written in C for management of Bosch ME7.1 firmware dumps.

RUNNING:

*********************************
** THIS PROGRAM HAS KNOWN BUGS **
*********************************

To check image.bin:

  ME7Check image.bin
  me7sum image.bin

To override detected checksum/CRC blocks, and/or display dump information:

  me7sum [-i image.ini] image.bin

To output corrected checksums (the "-i" option is still available, but optional)

  me7sum [-i image.ini] image.bin out.bin

** If in doubt, omit the -i option. You shouldn't use it unless you know what
you are doing. **

Note that if me7sum cannot completely detect checksum/CRC locations correctly,
it will not output a file!

** Always use me7sum on a original version of your bin first to make sure it is
   compatible! **

** Make sure to check all corrected bins with ME7Check.exe before flashing
   them! **

KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------
** RSA signature support is experimental, and may have bugs! **

ME7Check may fail on RSA corrected bins. This may or may not be a good sign,
and is still under testing.

WinOLS should NOT correct any checksums in an RSA corrected bin. If it does,
please email the binary to me or post on Nefmoto.

DO NOT FLASH ANY BINS without a backup ECU or a way to restore a known good
bin or you may be stranded!

It should generally autodetect checksum/CRC blocks, but is known not to work
on non VAG Motronic bins, eg:

ferrari360.bin

ME7.5 is also currently unsupported but might work.

For testing, regions can be overridden in an ini file. See sample.ini for
available block/image options, and ferrari360.ini for an example of using
the info and dump sections.

BUILDING:
---------
Under unix or cygwin, "make" should work.

Under Windows MSVSS/nmake , type "build clean" then "build"
